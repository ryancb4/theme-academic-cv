abstract: This report describes my internship with the 115th House of Representatives, focusing on my exposure to the integration of technologies like 5G and cloud networks within government operations. My activities included observing projects such as efforts to secure IRS communications, and studies on Russian information warfare. Additionally, I engaged in legislative discussions on topics like artificial intelligence, automated driving, and computer science. The internship afforded me the opportunity to participate in various hearings, briefings, and the legislative drafting process, enhancing my understanding of the legislative framework. This document reflects on the challenges encountered, lessons learned, and evaluates how the internship aligned with my academic coursework and future career aspirations, providing insights into the intersection of technology application and government operations.
