abstract: Students pursuing higher education often face numerous setbacks and challenges, with mental health emerging as a significant concern. While mental health issues are not unique to university settings, the intense cognitive demands and pressures experienced by students can exacerbate these challenges, leading to severe consequences. This analysis highlights that mental health in academia is multifaceted, influenced by various factors that collectively impact the overall well-being of students. The understanding of these dynamics is crucial for developing effective support systems within educational institutions.
