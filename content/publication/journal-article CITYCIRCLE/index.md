abstract: This work advocates for the adoption of circular infrastructure design as a solution for sustainable urban development. It highlights the shortcomings of linear grid systems and explores the benefits of circularity in enhancing flow, maintenance, and navigation. Practical applications of circular design are discussed, drawing examples from roundabouts and historical references like Plato's Atlantis. It proposes a holistic approach to urban planning, envisioning cities organized around a central point with concentric rings facilitating efficient transportation and resource allocation. Potential objections are acknowledged about cost and cultural acceptance but emphasizes the long-term advantages of circular infrastructure in mitigating urban sprawl, reducing traffic congestion, and fostering community well-being. Overall, the abstract presents circular infrastructure design as a strategic solution to meet the evolving needs of modern cities while promoting sustainability and resilience.
