abstract: This paper explores the concept that academic progress should be approached as a marathon rather than a sprint, emphasizing the importance of steady learning over rapid course completion. It addresses the challenges faced by students who struggle with the long-term demands of higher education and may lack motivation. The study suggests that adapting educational strategies to align with students' comfort zones can enhance engagement. One effective approach discussed is the gamification of lectures and quizzes, which can make learning more interactive and enjoyable, thereby improving student motivation and retention.
