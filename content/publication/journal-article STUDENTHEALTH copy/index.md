abstract: In this reflective report on my teaching practicum, I discuss my experiences and insights from applying an andragogical approach in a diverse classroom setting. The focus is on adapting teaching strategies to accommodate students at different levels of understanding and engagement, specifically through tailored instructional methods and the use of gamification to enhance learning. Key adjustments included the incorporation of real-world applications for advanced students and increased interactive activities to foster a deeper connection with the course material. Additionally, the report evaluates the efficacy of these methods in larger classes and the shift to online learning environments, where I emphasized providing more robust material and interactive tasks. Reflections on these teaching strategies reveal their impact on student engagement and learning outcomes, informing potential improvements for future coursework. This practice-oriented analysis aims to contribute to better educational strategies in diverse academic settings, aiming for inclusivity and effective learning.
