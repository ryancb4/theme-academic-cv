abstract: Human-robot interaction is a critical area of research, providing support for collaborative tasks where a human instructs a robot to interact with and manipulate objects in an environment. However, an under-explored element of these collaborative manipulation tasks are small-scale building exercises, in which the human and robot are working together in close proximity with the same set of objects. Under these conditions, it is essential to ensure the humanâ€™s safety and mitigate comfort risks during the interaction. As there is danger in exposing humans to untested robots, a safe and controlled environment is required. Simulation and virtual reality (VR) for HRI have shown themselves to be suitable tools for creating space for human-robot experimentation that can be beneficial in these scenarios.
