abstract: Industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) offers a multitude of sustainable applications. Unlike its psychoactive cousin, the entire lifecycle of hemp contains negligible amounts of THC. This distinction mirrors poppy seeds, which lack the opiate properties of mature poppy plants. Hemp boasts a rich history of industrial use, valued by the Founding Fathers for paper and clothing. Legislative efforts are underway to revitalize this promising industry, overcoming existing limitations. Advancements in 3D printing technology unlock a new frontier for hemp, enabling the creation of sustainable bioplastics, paper products, and even construction materials. This resurgence promises not only economic advantages through cost-effective and eco-friendly options but also significant environmental benefits by promoting the use of renewable resources.
