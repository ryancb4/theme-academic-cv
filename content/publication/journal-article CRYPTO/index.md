abstract: To address the critical need for data security in government and business sectors, the National Institute of Standards and Technology established the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) as part of FIPS197. Intel Corporation enhanced AES's efficiency by embedding specialized instructions into their processors, known as AES-NI. These enhancements significantly improve performance and security. The utility of AES-NI was further analyzed in runtime environments, demonstrating substantial benefits in encryption processes.
